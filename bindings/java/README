INSTALLATION
============

This directory contains Java bindings to libsipc and example
applications using these bindings.  There is also C source code that
is eventually compiled into a shared library.

To install the bindings, a few settings may need to be adjusted.  The
Makefile in this directory may need to be modified so that the build
process can locate the system's JNI include files.

Note that the directory into which the shared library is installed
must be in the dynamic linker's search path.
