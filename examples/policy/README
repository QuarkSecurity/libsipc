These are the sample policy files to support the secure IPC examples.  While
the examples could be run on a targeted system without these modules the
modules illustrate the permissions required to support applications using
the secure IPC library.

To function properly the example applications must reside within a user's home
directory and the sipc libraries must be installed into the system root, ie
/usr/lib, do not use DESTDIR when building.  Certain portions of the files will 
need to be changed before the policy will be functional.  Specifically the 
location of the example application.  Modify each ".fc" to reflect your
environment.

To build and install the policy run:

# make install-policy

as root.  This does three things: makes a backup of a file that must be updated
before building the policy modules, builds the policy modules, installs the 
policy modules, and labels the examples.  Now the example applications can be 
tested with SELinux policy modules.

After completing the tests the installation process can easily be reverted by
running:

# make clean

as root.  This replaces the updated file with the original, removes the 
policy modules, and relabels the examples.
